# Endless Bullet Nightmare
 Simple bullet-hell game.  Press right-click to add enemies.  Left-click for powerups, limited supply.  A, S, D equip different powers.  Standing near enemies disables them.  The circle around your cursor represent a quickly-recharging shield that can only take one hit.  Don't get hit twice!  You can also play this right now on https://openprocessing.org/sketch/945006
Or play the better version using the now-deprecated processing-js at https://openprocessing.org/sketch/1779321
